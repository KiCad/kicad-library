Hi All,
Glad to joint you in contribute to KiCAD Project. While I m still learning  the contribution process ( which I felt I'm too slow 
to understand the procedure ), I put my works on footprint and 3d models ( which I use in my project with KiCAD ) in my public-
shared at Google Drive in folder KICADLIB_JBD.pretty at this address :

Pls feel free to use them if you want. Pls free to modify, adjust and rename them. As well you can contact me via my email :
jbdwiyono@gmail.com or inbox in my facebook account ( Josef B. Dwiyono , jb.dwiyono@facebook.com ). By the time I ve had manage well
and understand well about the KiCAD official contribution procedure, I ll fully joint with you here.

Regularly I add the fp and its related models ( wrl and wings ). You can find it in activity logs at 
file "00 - UPLOAD FILES LIST - LOGS.ods". And some component's dimension / specs are included in folder DOCS.

(Very sorry for my bad english .. but hope you understand it ).

Thanks and best regards,
