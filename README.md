kicad-library
=============

The schematic and 3D libraries supported by KiCad team.

The footprint libraries are the `*.pretty` repos themselves and are used online by default. If you want to download them locally, the `library-repos-install.bat` and `library-repos-install.sh` scripts [in the KiCad source](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~kicad-product-committers/kicad/product/files/head:/scripts/) can do this automatically.
